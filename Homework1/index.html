        <p>Hello World. My name is Gerardo Laracuente, but everyone calls me Gerry. I've had an interest in technology
            my whole life. When I was a kid, I used to open up electronics and try to figure out how they worked. That
            curiosity is still alive in me today. I love to understand how things work, and it's a big part of my
            current job.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I'm a Data Center Engineer at Outbrain, Inc. The job title doesn't really describe what I actually do. I'm
            more of a Server Engineer, that uses DevOps principles to try to automate all the tasks I'm responsible
            for.
            I get to play around with a lot of great tools (mostly open source) such as Chef, Jenkins, Prometheus,
            Grafana, and Ruby/Bash scripting. </p>
        <br>
        <p>I'm currently learning Full Stack Web Development so I can be a better engineer. Maybe I'll end up building
            my own app one day.</p>
